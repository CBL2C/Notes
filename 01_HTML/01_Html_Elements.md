# HTML Elements
All content in a HTML file is contained within different elements

This is a paragraph element:
```html
<p>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```
<br>

### Tags

### Opening and Closing Tags

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```

In this example, ```<p>``` is the opening tag and ```</p>``` is the closing tag.  
An element's tags have ```< >``` angle brackets to signify to the browser that this is HTML to be read.
  
Closing tags in HTML are always signified by a slash ```/```

<br>

### Self-closing Tags (Void Elements)
A self-closing tag, or void element, does not have a start and end tag. 

```html
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
or
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
A void element is contained in a single tag. This kind of element may have an optional closing slash at the end of its tag.

```<meta>```, ```<img>```, and ```<br>``` are all examples of void elements.
