# HTML Elements
All content in a HTML file is contained within different elements

This is a paragraph element:
```html
<p>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```
<br>

## Tags

### Opening and Closing Tags

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```

In this example, ```<p>``` is the opening tag and ```</p>``` is the closing tag.  
An element's tags have ```< >``` angle brackets to signify to the browser that this is HTML to be read
  
Closing tags in HTML are always signified by a slash ```/```

<br>

### Self-closing Tags (Void Elements)
A self-closing tag, or void element, does not have a start and end tag

```html
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
or
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
A void element is contained in a single tag. This kind of element may have an optional closing slash at the end of its tag

```<meta>```, ```<img>```, and ```<br>``` are all examples of void elements

<br>

## Basic Page Elements

The basic elements of an HTML page are:

- A text header denoted using the ```<h1>```, ```<h2>```, ```<h3>```, ```<h4>```, ```<h5>```, ```<h6>``` tags
- A paragraph denoted using the ```<p>``` tag
- A horizontal ruler denoted using the ```<hr>``` tag
- A link denoted using the ```<a>``` (anchor) tag
- A list denoted using the ```<ul>``` (unordered list), ```<ol>``` (ordered list) and ```<li>``` (list element) tags
- An image denoted using the ```<img>``` tag
- A divider denoted using the ```<div>``` tag
- A text span denoted using the ```<span>``` tag

<br>

## Semantic and Non-Semantic Elements

**Semantic** elements are elements with meaning.   
A semantic element describes its meaning to both developers and the browser. Its name is descriptive and indicative of its function:

* ```<form>```
* ```<head>```
* ```<nav>```
* ```<footer>```

**Non-Semantic** elements tell you nothing about their content:
* ```<div>```
* ```<span>```

<br>

## Special Elements
### ```<span>```
The ```<span>``` element is an HTML element that allows you to drop a CSS class or id hook wherever you need with no unwanted side effects.
