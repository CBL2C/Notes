# HTML Attributes
 


```html
<p id="welcome" class="placeholder" hidden>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```

**Attributes** can be added to the opening tags of HTML elements. 

An attribute typically has a name and a value. 

Above, the attribute name is ```id```, the attribute value is the string ```"welcome"```, and they are separated by an ```=``` equals sign.

Multiple atributes can be added to an HTML element by adding a space between attribute declarations.

## Boolean Attributes
```html
<p hidden>Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```

Some attributes will not have values, as they have their "true" state implied by existing in the tag. 

```hidden``` is one such attribute - by being present in the tag, the element is hidden. This element's existence implies its function is active.

## Other Attributes

Most attributes in HTML follow the following format. Here, the attribute we are using as an example is ```id```.

```html
<p id="welcome">Lorem ipsum kitten doughnut french press suspenders lolcat</p>
```

```id```'s attribute value must be a single string with no spaces.

The value of ```id``` must:
* Start with a letter
* use ```-``` hyphen or ```_``` underscore to connext multiple words in the string
