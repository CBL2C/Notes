## Web Development Fundementals

### HTML vs. CSS vs. JS

#### HTML
- HyperText Markup Language
- Used to structure and define webpage content 
    - text, images, audio, video, forms, etc
- First language of the web 
    - most basic building block of a web page

#### CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets
    - Changes apply top-down, later changes **overwrite** previous changes
- Create webpage appearance, styles & positioning 
    - fonts, colors, margins, animations, etc

#### JS
- JavaScript
    - Programming language 
    - able to make computations and transform data according to logical 
instructions
- Can change the HTML and CSS of a webpage and make it dynamic: change it in response to conditions in the code
- Most powerful & complex of the three core technologies

### Web Design vs. Web Development
#### Web Design
- Graphic design, aesthetic concerns such as fonts, colors, layout
- Web designers create the design and hands off to web developer to translate it into code

#### Web Development is NOT Web Design

### Web Development
### Front End vs. Back End vs. Full Stack
#### Front End
- Code downloaded to & run on client-side computer 
    - CSS, HTML, JavaScript

#### Back End
- Code on the server-side computer that responds to requests from the client 
    - can be JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, etc

#### Full Stack 
 - Both front and back end together

### Libraries and Frameworks
- Developers often package reuseable code as open-source libraries and frameworks
- Shared with other developers to use instead of reinventing wheel 
- Many CSS & JavaScript libraries and frameworks
- Rare to write webpages from scratch without using one or more
- After learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript, next step is to start learning popular libraries/frameworks
