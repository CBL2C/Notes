# Page Structure & Layout

HTML is the most basic building block of the web.  
It provides the basic structure of a page's layout - text, media, ads, navigation, etc.

**Page Structure:**

An HTML file is comprised of two basic components: 
* the Head
* the Body 

A footer is sometimes added on after the main body, but this is optional. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>HTML 5 Boilerplate Starter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
