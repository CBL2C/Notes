# CSS Layouts and Styling

## Box Model
The Box model is the default style available in CSS. If you do not apply rules for any of your own styling, the Box Model will be applied

See [Box Model](../02_CSS/03_Box_Model.md)

## Grid 
Grid Layout creates a grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning for CSS Box Model elements

See [Grid](../02_CSS/04_Grid.md)
