# CSS Using Bootstrap
## What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a giant collection of handy, reusable bits of code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s also a frontend development framework that enables developers and designers to quickly build fully responsive websites.

Essentially, Bootstrap saves time by avoiding writing lots of CSS, giving back time to spend on designing webpages.

**Bootstrap is popular because it has:**
* Responsive Grid
* Responsive Images
* Selected JQuery plugins
* Components:
    * Navigation bars
    * Dropdowns
    * Progress bars
    * Thumbnails
