# What is Javascript?

## Javascript's History
Javascript was originally created as an addition to Netscape Navigator ( a predecessor to Firefox & the most popular browser at the time) 

JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language.  
Javascript was merely named similarly because Java was an extremely popular language at the time. The name was an attempt to piggyback on that popularity.

JavaScript became the dominant language for web client-side programming because of early adoption by international standards body ECMA & because of built-in Javascript support by multiple browsers.

Javascript and ECMAscript are essentially synonymous. 

The latest major revision of Javascript is ES6 in 2015. This introduced major changes such as const, let, and arrow functions.
